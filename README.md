![Build](https://github.com/MahjongRepository/tenhou-python-bot/workflows/Mahjong%20bot/badge.svg) [[Tests coverage]](http://mahjongrepository.github.io/tenhou-python-bot/)

The project is not maintained anymore, and exists primary for historical reasons and references.

Bot was tested with Python 3.7+ and PyPy3, we are not supporting Python 2.

# What do we have here?

## Mahjong bot

For research purposes we built a simple bot to play riichi mahjong. It can be run locally.

# For developers

## How to run it?

1. `pip install -r requirements/lint.txt`
1. Run `cd project && python main.py` it will connect to the tenhou.net and will play a game.

## How to run bot battle with pypy

To make it easier run bot vs bot battles we prepared PyPy3 Docker container.

Run the game locally:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
1. Run `make build_docker`
1. Run `make GAMES=1 run_battle` it will play one game locally. Logs and replays will be stored in `bots_battle` folder.

Run bots with enabled decision logger (use it only for debug, since it harms performance):
1. Run `make GAMES=1 ARGS=--logs run_battle`

## Run multiple bots to play one game

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. Run `make build_docker`
1. Put bot configs to `project/settings/`. By default we are looking for these configs: `bot_1_settings.py`, `bot_2_settings.py`, `bot_3_settings.py`, `bot_4_settings.py`, `bot_5_settings.py`. Why 5 settings? Because tenhou doesn't start 2+ game in the custom lobby if you are running only 4 bots.
1. Run `make run_on_tenhou`

## Configuration instructions

1. Put your own settings to the `project/settings/settings_local.py` file. 
They will override settings from default `settings/base.py` file.
1. Also, you can override some default settings with command arguments. 
Use `python main.py -h` to check all available commands.

## Game reproducer

It can be useful to debug bot errors or strange discards: [game reproducer](doc/reproducer.md)
